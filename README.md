Notes from Anthony:

- Make sure you have Node.js installed (select to automatically install all tools)

To get running do the following:

- cd into 'flask-server' and execute 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (or 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt')

- cd into 'react-app' and execute the following command 'npm install'

- while being in 'react-app' you will now be able to run the project quickly through just the following command 'npm run dev' (this should be in the docker files i believe later)
    - it might be better to have 2 terminals open and on one execute "npm run start", and the other execute "npm run start-backend" (execute commands while cd in 'react-app')

currently this will run the flask backend on http://localhost:5000, and will run the react frontend on http://localhost:3000 (both of these should also probably be changed later in docker files)
